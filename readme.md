# Database description
The project is designed with a database named healthcare_management_system. It helps in providing a simple interface for providing medical assistance to users. The project provides comprehensive and transparent reports of doctors and nearby hospitals on one platform which consequently helps in enhancing the accessibility of medical information. This system is to facilitate the center to retrieve, update, and report the patient information efficiently, in turn helping the doctors make timely, effective diagnoses.

The data will consist of strings (varchar) of text for information like name, username, address, etc of users and admin. To make it cross platform, the public data will be stored in a MySQL server, accessible through REST apis. As a result, we can be integrated with mobile and other web enabled softwares. The inspiration behind this project is to deliver a report for some of the most common medical issues encountered by people and help in maintaining a certain level of transparency and integrity on health care services.
