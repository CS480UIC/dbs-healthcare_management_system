# Database description
We would like to design and develop a database called healthcare_management_system. The aim of our project is to make an platform where we can give professional healthcare/medical advice to the end users. This project helps patients to connect to lot of hosipitals/doctors nearby and make better healthcare decisions. With the help of this platform, the patients can now explore different options, book online appointments, get tests done, order medicines, keep track of their health regularly, all on a single platform.
